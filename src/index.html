</head>  <h1>Old-Fashioned Blackberry Cobbler</h1>
<p>
	If you're looking for an old-fashioned, do-not-stir style of blackberry cobbler, you've come to the right place. 
	The batter magically rises through the blackberry mixture to become the topping, with crispy, chewy, buttery edges. 
	The no-stirring instructions are important to ensure the butter moves to the outer edges for a perfectly baked crust.
